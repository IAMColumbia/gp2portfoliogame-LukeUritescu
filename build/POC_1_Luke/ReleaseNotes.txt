Release Notes version 1 POC

Version 1.1:
I have been able to get an enemy moving around which can detect through sight when it sees the player.
Player can move around by clicking with the mouse

I still need to get the shooting mechanic to work.
I have the weapon system set up through the strategy pattern and will work once the projectile mechanic works.

I am much further behind at this point than I was expecting.
