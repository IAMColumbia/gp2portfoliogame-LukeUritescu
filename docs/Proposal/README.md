Proposal:

Game Name: The adventures of Deckard Cain 2: Stay A While and Listen

Summary brief of game mechanics:
The terribly drawn blobs are attacking your home village, and you are the only one capable of stopping their violence with more violence. Once you have eliminated their leader, head back to the village to notify everyone they are safe.

Description Short: This is a classic dungeon crawler game. The objective of the game is to make it through the cave and get past the enemies to the enemy boss. Once the enemy boss is defeated you will be notified the quest is completed and will tell you to head back to the entrance to beat the game.

Description Long: 
Player:
This will resemble the same gameplay as old school Diablo games. You will move the player with the mouse, the player will have a normal attack that uses the left click , and three spells they can cast using different keys on the keyboard. Depending on what spell the player casts will result in a different noise level. 
Enemy:
The enemies will have sight, and hearing. They can chase, attack, and patrol. If an enemy is within range of “hearing” the noise the player has created it will chase after the player. If the player attacks the boss, any remaining enemies will be notified and chase after the player. 

I believe this game will benefit from the command, and observer pattern. My hopes are that with the command pattern, the player will be able to choose betweeen using a keyboard or controller.

Genre: Dungeon crawler adventure.
Platform: PC. I will most likely use Monogame unless I find Unity will have more helpful tools than Monnogame.
